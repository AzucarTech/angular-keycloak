# Node/Keycloak Batch Assist
This project was created to facilitate batch user entries into Keycloak and for user email verification to be automated in the process.

# Running or testing the node project
```sh
npm install
```

Run the dev set-up:
```sh
npm run dev
```

That will trigger the dev.js file to start running the index.js file with a set of curated parameters.
